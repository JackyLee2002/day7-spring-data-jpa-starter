O: I learned more about Spring Data JPA and its integration with MySQL databases. Spring Data JPA simplifies the implementation of data access layers by reducing boilerplate code and providing a repository abstraction over the data store. Using Spring Initializr, I was able to quickly set up a Spring Boot application with Spring Data JPA dependencies. I also practiced creating entity classes, defining repositories, and performing CRUD operations. Additionally, I learned to write unit tests for the data access layer to ensure the correctness of the database interactions. Lastly, I also did a lot of practice on Mocking using the Mockito libraries to stub the necessary function calls to achieve both unit test and e2e/integration tests.

R: Agreeable

I: Having used Spring Data JPA for both work and personal projects, I find it quite familiar and agreeable since its a common ORM standard used in most Spring projects. Spring Data JPA significantly reduces the configuration time through auto-configuration and the use of specific annotations like @Entity, @Repository, and @Query. I also delved deeper into the core features and principles of Spring Data JPA, such as the Criteria API and JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language).

D: I plan to become more familiar with Spring Data JPA and its advanced features, including some I rarely use, like custom repository implementations to generate SQL using code and auditing. This will help me expand my knowledge of the framework and support a larger variety of use cases while making sure that correct usage of Spring Data JPA with sufficient and comprehensive testing.
